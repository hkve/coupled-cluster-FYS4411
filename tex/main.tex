                Implementation of Hartree-Fock (HF) and Coupled Cluster using doubles excitations (CCD) are benchmarked using a Quantum dot (QD), modeled as a two-dimensional Harmonic Oscillator (2DHO) potential. Application to $s$-type hydrogen states for Helium and Beryllium bypassed both HF and Configuration Interaction using single excitations (CIS). Implementations in both restricted and unrestricted schemes display a constant time improvement in favor of the restricted schemes, applicable to the closed shell systems used. Low frequency solutions were obtained for 2 and 6 particles giving $\omega_c < 0.01$ and $\omega_c = 0.0621$ respectively, where the electron-electron interaction strength is significantly higher than the confining HO potential. Comparisons with both variational and singles added schemes ($\Lambda-$CCSD, CCSD) present in the literature was performed, with deviations explained by the doubles' truncation presented in this work.
