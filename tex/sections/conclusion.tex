The implementations of HF and CCD, in both restricted and unrestricted schemes were successful. Benchmarking the $s$-orbital hydrogen basis, we found that CCD using a HF basis outperformed CIS for both Helium and Beryllium. The improvement over CI was particularly good for Beryllium, reducing the relative error from $2.08\%$ for CI to $1.05\%$ for CCD using a HF basis. However, most of the improvement was achieved due to the HF basis being particularly good.

For the QD, the $N = 2, \omega = 1.0$ analytical result was reproduced using $12$ shells with a relative error of only $0.196\%$. Here HF produced a relative error of $5.397\%$, which displays that electron correlations is an important factor in the HO system.
