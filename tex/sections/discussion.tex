Defiantly mention
\begin{enumerate}
    \item CC not variational bad.
    \item HF basis good
    \item Hydrogen $l \neq 0$ difficult.
    \item Lower frequencies harder for convergence.
    \item Not having singles when comparing to article
    \item How much does energy improve from ref to HF compared to HF to CCD
\end{enumerate}
