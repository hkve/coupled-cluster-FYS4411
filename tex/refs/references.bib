Topics addressed include computational aspects of the CC method; extended CC methods that include single, double, and triple excitation operators; and a multi-reference CC technique. Numerical examples illustrate CC results for correlation energies compared to those from full CI and multi-reference CI calculations.},

  abstract = {Wick's theorem provides a connection between time ordered products of bosonic or fermionic fields, and their normal ordered counterparts. We consider a generic pair of operator orderings and we prove, by induction, the theorem that relates them. We name this the General Wick's Theorem (GWT) because it carries Wick's theorem as special instance, when one applies the GWT to time and normal orderings. We establish the GWT both for bosonic and fermionic operators, i.e. operators that satisfy c-number commutation and anticommutation relations respectively. We remarkably show that the GWT is the same, independently from the type of operator involved. By means of a few examples, we show how the GWT helps treating demanding problems by reducing the amount of calculations required.},

            SymPy is an open source computer algebra system written in pure Python. It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, through both interactive and programmatic applications. These characteristics have led SymPy to become a popular symbolic library for the scientific Python ecosystem. This paper presents the architecture of SymPy, a description of its features, and a discussion of select submodules. The supplementary material provide additional examples and further outline details of the architecture and features of SymPy.

A complete classification of asymptotic energy levels is performed and the behaviour of energy levels from the quantum to the semiclassical regime is traced. Comparison between the present results and those from exact numerical Hamiltonian diagonalization indicates a fair accuracy of the proposed method over the whole range of the electron-electron coupling constant and magnetic field values. The results obtained indicate that increasing the number of electrons in a dot leads to more classical behaviour of the system.},
