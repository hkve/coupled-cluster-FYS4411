  abstract = {Coupled-cluster (CC) theory for the accurate treatment of electron correlation is presented including its similarities and differences from configuration interaction (CI). Topics addressed include computational aspects of the CC method; extended CC methods that include single, double, and triple excitation operators; and a multi-reference CC technique. Numerical examples illustrate CC results for correlation energies compared to those from full CI and multi-reference CI calculations.},
